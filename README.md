Open source electric longboard controller

Currently clone from [SolidGeek nrf24 controller](https://github.com/SolidGeek/nRF24-Esk8-Remote), with some modifications to better fit our needs.

You will need some arduino libraries, but using the arduino ide you just search them up. One for example is the nrf24 library.
